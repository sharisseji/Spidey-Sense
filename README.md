# Spidey-Sense

Spidey Sense is a smart, wearable navigation assistant that uses AI-driven computer vision and ultrasonic proximity detection to help visually impaired users avoid obstacles and identify objects in real time.

## Build
### Hardware:
ESP32-CAM for real-time image capture and processing.
Arduino Uno for controlling ultrasonic sensors and audio output.
Ultrasonic Sensors for distance measurement.
Speaker Module for relaying voice-guided assistance.

### Software:
Python with OpenCV & YOLOv3 for AI-driven object detection.
C++ (Arduino) for sensor control and audio feedback processing.
WiFi Communication between ESP32-CAM and the laptop for efficient AI inference.
